# CSC-365

The programs I made in my CSC 365 course at SUNY Oswego.
NOTE: This class consisted of three project periods in which we gradually developed a sentiment analysis machine for a collection of 5,000 movie review text files. The java class files included are the two classes used in the final, completed version from the end of the semester.
